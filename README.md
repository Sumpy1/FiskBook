The FiskBook real-time chat application is a collaborative creation by Gopal Pokharel and Manish Bhusal, crafted as a significant component of their sophomore project at Fisk University. Tailored explicitly for the dynamic needs of Fisk University students, this chat platform serves as a nexus for fostering connections, facilitating communication, and cultivating a vibrant network within the Fisk student community.

Designed with the intention of becoming the primary hub for Fisk University students, the application seamlessly integrates features that empower students to seek and share information, be it of a personal or professional nature. One notable feature is the group chat functionality, strategically included to extend its reach to international students hailing from diverse backgrounds. This global perspective aims to foster a sense of community and belonging while providing valuable opportunities related to work and internships, particularly for students seeking sponsorship.

The underlying technologies driving this innovative project include Vue.js, Node.js, CSS and React for front-end development. Leveraging Socket.IO, the application achieves low-latency, bidirectional, and event-based communication between clients and servers, ensuring a responsive and dynamic user experience. For secure database management, the developers have seamlessly integrated Chatengine.io, enhancing the overall robustness of the system. Additionally, Vite.js APIs are employed to rigorously validate user credentials, contributing to the application's security and reliability.   

In summary, it encapsulates the essence of community, knowledge sharing, and international collaboration, thereby enhancing the overall university experience for Fisk students.
